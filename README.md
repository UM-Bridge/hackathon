# UM-Bridge Hackathon 2024

![UM-Bridge logo](/UM-bridge.png)

UM-Bridge is a language-agnostic interface linking Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) packages and numerical model software. It allows

* Speeding up UQ projects from prototype to HPC
* Making UQ and model software available to a wide audience
* Reproducible, community-driven UQ benchmarking

For more information, see [UM-Bridge documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/).

This hackathon is intended as a space to work on concrete UM-Bridge projects. This could mean getting your own application running with UM-Bridge, working on some of our open issues or even integrating new languages or software.
